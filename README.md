# Phoenix-Chatbot
1. Phoenix Chatbot Demo video: (https://youtu.be/4ksBrPvaVI0?si=szhC5DM9SrsKTlrB)
2. The Chatbot was once deployed on GCP but is currently inactive due to cost limitations. However, you can view the demo video showcasing its functionality when it was accessible.
3. This is a versatile Multi-Topic Information Retrieval Chatbot capable of handling casual conversation and responding to queries about 10 distinct Wikipedia topics, while also generating dynamic visualizations of search results
4. Used Solr for indexing and retrieval of coherent responses, combined with multinomial NB to achieve a 70% accuracy in classifying user queries. Ultimately, created a Flask API endpoint with all the components & deployed it on the GCP.
